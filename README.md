# torch-js 
Torch (or Torchcode) is an independently made Javascript library made by Zak Schenck.
Its goal is to shorten common functions and lines of code into one line. Many of its attributes are customizable with parameters.

## Some common use cases are
• Adding a quick hamburger toggle menu (or any dropdown toggle). <br />
• Quickly utilizing "click" event functions for multiple uses. <br />
• Animations such as menu slider animations and basic movement. <br />
• Quick display and hide on elements. <br />
• Basic loop through array function. <br />
• Basic math and working with numbers. <br /> <br />

To start, install the package and run a function by using $T. <br />
A basic function to hide an element would be <br />
$T.off('.yourClass')
